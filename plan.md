# RF GDS Library Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development of a Python library that converts human-readable YAML descriptions of RFIC (Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit) designs into GDS(II) files ready for simulation. The library will leverage gdsfactory for the GDS generation process and will specifically focus on RF components and their requirements.

## Project Goals

1. Create a user-friendly library that allows RF engineers to define complex RF structures in YAML
2. Generate industry-standard GDS(II) output files that can be used with simulation tools

4. Provide a flexible, extensible architecture that can be expanded to support new components
5. Ensure high-quality documentation and examples to facilitate adoption
