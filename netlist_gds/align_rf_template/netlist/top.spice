* top.spice â€” ALIGN-friendly SPICE-style netlist (template)
* Map of original ADS/EM snippet:
*   MomCmpt:em_data   -->  XEM1 p1 p2 EM1  (hard macro OR parametric PCell for EM structure)
*   USC_PF25_SMIM:C924 -->  XCMIM n65 n77 CMIM L=120u W=100u  (parametric MIM/MOM PCell or macro)
*   GRM15:C930 (off-chip) --> handled as PAD interface (not on-die device), connect to PAD pin
*   S_Param:SP1 (simulation) --> remove from layout netlist; not used by ALIGN

* ----- Subcircuit library stubs -----
* You will attach these to layout generators (PCell) OR to hard GDS macros via ALIGN's library mechanisms.

* EM structure as a black-box subckt (for layout: place macro or generate geometry)
.SUBCKT EM1 P1 P2 PARAMS: L=120u W=100u N=3 METAL=M6
* For circuit sims you would use EM results; for layout we just expose pins.
Rleak P1 P2 1e12
.ENDS EM1

* MIM capacitor as a parametric PCell placeholder
.SUBCKT CMIM P N PARAMS: L=120u W=100u METAL_TOP=M4 METAL_BOT=M3
* For sims use C value from PEX or ideal placeholder
C0 P N 1p
.ENDS CMIM

* IO pad placeholder (to connect off-chip parts like GRM15)
.SUBCKT PAD P
Rpad P 0 1e12
.ENDS PAD

* ----- Top-level -----
* Nets renamed for clarity; adjust to your naming.
* Example: external node N__91 is broken out to a PAD.
*         ADS EM block ports P1/P2 connect to n_in/n_out here.
*         Replace values/params with your real ones.
* 
* Instantiate EM block
XEM1  n_in n_out  EM1  L=120u W=100u N=3
* Instantiate MIM cap (from ADS line: USC_PF25_SMIM:C924 N__65 N__77 l=120um w=100um)
XCMIM n65 n77     CMIM L=120u W=100u
* Off-chip cap (GRM15) side exposed by PAD; connect N__91 to PAD
XPAD1 n91 PAD

* Tie ground
